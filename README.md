## Overview

The chart’s bars height and text content is made to be dynamically generatable with the use of JSON data file.

Daily spending can be seen on hover.

Current day is highlighted automatically.

The component is responsive and has some preload animation.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Make the bars height and text content to be dynamically generatable with the use of JSON data file
- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different color to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
